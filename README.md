### About Me 
Hello! I am an experienced paraprofessional Biology Lab Assistant with a year of proven expertise in Biohealth with a specialization in Biotechnology and Biopharma. 
With skills in data analysis, communication, detail-orientation, and teamwork, I am able to perform a Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) , and achieve making many copies of a specific DNA region. I am adept at using excel, Micro-centrifuges, and Pipettes and MS Access. 
My well-rounded skill set, commitment to detail, curiosity, and passion for knowledge makes me as a valuable asset.  In my spare time, I like to play classical music on the violin and go on daily runs. You can find me on www.linkedin.com/in/miguel-maldonado-briones-1391872a6.
